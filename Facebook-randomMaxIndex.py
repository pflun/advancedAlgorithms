# Generate random max index
# Given an array of integers, randomly return an index of the maximum value seen by far.
# e.g. Given [11,30,2,30,30,30,6,2,62, 62]
# Having iterated up to the at element index 5 (where the last 30 is), randomly give an index among [1, 3, 4, 5]
# which are indices of 30 - the max value by far. Each index should have a Â¼ chance to get picked.
# Having iterated through the entire array, randomly give an index between 8 and 9 which are indices of the max value 62.
