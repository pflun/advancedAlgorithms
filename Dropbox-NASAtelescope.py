# NASA selects Dropbox as its official partner, and weâ€™re tasked with managing
# a panorama for the universe. The Hubble telescope (or some other voyager we
# have out there) will occasionally snap a photo of a sector of the universe,
# and transmit it to us. You are to help write a data structure to manage this.
# For the purpose of this problem, assume that the observable universe has been
# divided into 2D sectors. Sectors are indexed by x- and y-coordinates.
