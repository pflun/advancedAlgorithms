# If n == 1, there would be k-ways to paint.
#
# if n == 2, there would be two situations:
#
# 2.1 You paint same color with the previous post: k*1 ways to paint, named it as same
# 2.2 You paint differently with the previous post: k*(k-1) ways to paint this way, named it as dif
# So, you can think, if n >= 3, you can always maintain these two situations,
# You either paint the same color with the previous one, or differently.
#
# Since there is a rule: "no more than two adjacent fence posts have the same color."
#
# We can further analyze:
#
# from 2.1, since previous two are in the same color, next one you could only paint differently, and it would form one part of "paint differently" case in the n == 3 level, and the number of ways to paint this way would equal to same*(k-1).
# from 2.2, since previous two are not the same, you can either paint the same color this time (dif*1) ways to do so, or stick to paint differently (dif*(k-1)) times.
# Here you can conclude, when seeing back from the next level, ways to paint the same, or variable same would equal to dif*1 = dif, and ways to paint differently, variable dif, would equal to same*(k-1)+dif*(k-1) = (same + dif)*(k-1)
